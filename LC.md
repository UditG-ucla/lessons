# LendingClub
We look at historical Lending Club data and fit a classification model to predict which loans default and which don't.
The code is broken into two parts: 
(1) First part focusses on exploratory data analysis and identifying a smaller set of useful features
(2) In second part we fit classifications models using the identified features
