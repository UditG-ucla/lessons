Card Game - WAR

A deck of cards is shuffled and split between two players. Players then take turns playing 1 card each. 
Each card has a value between 2 and 11. Players with the higher value card, collects both cards played.
Winning player plays the first card in next round (this order matters to how cards stack up on the table
and are finally picked by either player.)

WAR: if the value of cards player by each player matches, then game enter 'War' phase, in which each player
puts 3 additional cards on the table, and then play the next card, which is compared to determine the winner. 
In case the cards played have same value again, WAR is repeated.

The game ends when either player has 0 cards, or insufficient cards to continue playing (for example, if a
player only has 2 cards when WAR is declared!)
